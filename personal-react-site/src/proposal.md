My app is a weather app that will let users input their city and state, and then display the current weather in their selected area. These are people who don't have a tv and don't have weather apps downloaded onto their phones. 

-----------------------------------------------------

In the space of two days, I hope to have a usable weather app with three pages on with the current weather, one with a summary of terms, and one with historic weather events.

-----------------------------------------------------

user 1 - uses the app to check current weather before heading out to see some friends a couple of towns over

user 2 - uses the app to decide if the weather is okay enough that she wants to meet her friend at the park

user 3 - uses the app to help him come up with a reason to miss work.

user 4 - uses the app to determine what she wants to wear for the day.

user 5 - uses the app to help decide if he wants to start a fire in his fireplace

user 6 = uses the app to decide if she should take an umbrella with her to the grocery store

user 7 - uses the app to learn about historical weather events for a class project

user 8 - uses the app to look up a word she just heard on the weather channel
